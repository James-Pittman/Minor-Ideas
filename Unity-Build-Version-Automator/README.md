# BuildVersionProccesor
 This is a Unity script that will automatically update a Unity projects build version under the projects Player settings every time a project is built. It will increment the build version by 0.1 every time a build happens. It will also include the date and time of the build. The BuildVersionProcessor script must be in a folder named "Editor" in your Unity project so that it is not included with the project on build.
 
# ShowVersion
 Also included is a script that will set any Unity text object it is attached to with the current version number.
